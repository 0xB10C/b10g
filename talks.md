## BitDevs NYC June 2019: *Building mempool.observer - mempool stats and visualizations*

I demonstrated mempool.observer and talked about past challenges, current todos and future ideas at the [BitDevs NYC Socratic Seminar 93](https://bitdevs.org/2019-06-13-socratic-seminar-93) on June June 2019. Slides can be found [here](/pdfs/memo-bitdevs-nyc.pdf).
