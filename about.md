On the internet I go by **0xb10c**.
But I'm also known as Timo.
I'm interrested in **Bitcoin**. 
Especially the fee-market, feerate estimation and transaction fees in general somehow struck me. 
I write code quite often, blog posts less often.
Code currently mostly in **Go** and **Python**. 
I do also like **visualisations**, working with **data** and **teaching about Bitcoin**. 
I work as a **freelancer developer** and **consultant**, mostly on Bitcoin related projects. 
You can reach me either over [email](mailto:0xb10c+contact&gma/il.com), via [keybase](https://keybase.io/b10c) or with [@0xB10C](https://twitter.com/0xB10C) on twitter.
